# Release Notes - v0.1.2

## 🔥 Critical Bug Fix Release

**Release Date:** November 7, 2025

This release fixes a critical issue where commands were not available when the extension was installed from a VSIX package.

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Commands Not Found in Packaged Extension
**Fixed the most critical issue reported by users:**
- ✅ Fixed `command 'rapidkit.createWorkspace' not found` error
- ✅ Fixed `command 'rapidkit.addWorkspace' not found` error
- ✅ Fixed `command 'rapidkit.refreshWorkspaces' not found` error
- ✅ All toolbar buttons and context menu items now work correctly

**Root Cause:**
The extension was not packaging all required runtime dependencies (`node_modules`), causing activation to fail silently when installed from VSIX. Commands worked fine in development mode but failed in production.

**Solution:**
Updated `.vscodeignore` to include all necessary runtime dependencies until we implement proper bundling with esbuild/webpack.

## 🔧 Technical Changes

- **Dependency Packaging:** Updated build configuration to include complete `node_modules` in VSIX
- **Vitest Update:** Upgraded Vitest to v4.0.7 to align with @vitest/coverage-v8 peer requirements
- **Build Process:** Improved packaging to ensure all dependencies are available at runtime
