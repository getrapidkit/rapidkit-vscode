## ✨ What's New

### 🎯 Interactive Module Browser

Browse and manage 27+ RapidKit modules directly from the extension:

- **Grid/List Views** - Switch between different viewing modes
- **Search & Filter** - Find modules by name or category
- **Installation Status** - See at a glance what's installed (installed/update available/not installed)
- **One-Click Install/Update** - Install modules directly without terminal
- **Module Details** - View descriptions, versions, and dependencies
- **Sidebar Explorer** - Quick access to all modules organized by category
- **Real-time Sync** - Status updates automatically when you install/update

### 🔧 Intelligent Setup Wizard

Pre-flight checks before workspace creation ensure you have everything needed:

- **Step 1: Python 3.10+** - Validates Python installation with venv support
- **Step 2: RapidKit Core** - Checks if RapidKit Core is installed locally
- **Step 3: npm Package** - Verifies rapidkit npm package is available
- **Step 4: Package Manager** - Select your preferred installation method (Poetry/pip/pipx)

Each step shows clear status and auto-detects installed environments.

### 📦 Package Manager Selection

Three methods to choose from, each with different benefits:

#### Poetry (Recommended ⭐)
- Automatically manages virtual environments
- Intelligent dependency resolution
- Best for beginners and modern workflows
- One-click installation available

#### pip (Optional)
- Standard Python package manager
- Works with existing Python installations
- For users who prefer manual venv management

#### pipx (Optional)
- Isolated tool installation
- Great for command-line tools
- No virtual environment needed
